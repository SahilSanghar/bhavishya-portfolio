            LLM to train an LLM! Ô∏è‚Äçüî• <br /><br />
            I built an agentic no-code tool that fine-tunes an LLM with the most optimal parameters in 4 simple steps.<br /><br />

            Step 1. Give the hugging face model id<br /><br />

            Step 2: Upload your data<br /><br />

            Step 3: Give instructions - what do you want the LLM to do with the data? What operations do you want it to perform? Based on this information it codes the formatting function that performs operations on the data (function calling)<br /><br />

            Step 4: This acts like a parallel grid search. You can add as many new sets of parameters as you want, and in the end, it will show you the best-performing parameter based on the least average loss. <br /><br />
